The oldest person recorded with the name Abbas, was born in the year 647. Just like the phone number. There was no famous people with the name Abbaszadeh, so the most famous person with the name Abbas, was Abbas I of Persia, also known as Abbas the Great. He was the 5th Safavid Shah of Iran, and is generally considered one of the greatest rulers of Iranian history and the Safavid dynasty. The flag below, was the flag of the empire that controlled the region where Iran currently is. So this flag was when the first recorded person named 'Abbas' lived. This is the flag of the Sassanid, or Sasanin, Empire, which was a Persian one.";

The name 'Sherwin' is also a name, but not a Persian one. It is Anglo-Saxon and it meant 'Bright' or 'Friend'. Shervin is not a very common name at all anywhere but Iran, so the most famous person with the name Shervin, is Shervin Pishevar, who is an Iranian-American venture capitalist and entrepenuer. It is said that he has a net worth of $60 million, but some say it is in the billions range.";

It is also a very common Irish biblical name and it also has Hebrew origin. So in Irish my name means 'God is Gracious'. Pretty cool right? In Farsi, my name means 'King of all Kings'. Lastly, a cool thing I found is that the name Keone, means 'The homeland' in Hawaiian. The most famous person with my name is Dave Keon. He was one of the players on the Toronto Maple Leafs when we last one the Stanley Cup in 1967. The image below is a photo of Dave Keon when he played for the Leafs.";
